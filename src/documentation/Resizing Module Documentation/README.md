# Resizing Module Documentation

This module facilitates the resizing of an image based on user-input for the new dimensions (width and height) while ensuring the original aspect ratio is maintained. The core functionality is encapsulated within the `Resize_Click` and `ResizeFunction_1` methods.

## Core Methods

### `Resize_Click`

- **Parameters:**
  - `object sender`: The source of the event.
  - `EventArgs e`: An EventArgs that contains the event data.

- **Behavior:**
  - Captures the desired dimensions from the user via a form (`Form2`).
  - Calls `ResizeFunction_1` with the current image and new dimensions as arguments.
  - Invokes `DrawFully` with the resized image to render it on the drawing area.

### `ResizeFunction_1`

- **Parameters:**
  - `Image image`: The original image.
  - `int WantedWidth`: The desired width (0 ≤ WantedWidth ≤ 1000 pixels).
  - `int WantedHeight`: The desired height (Interval and unit similar to WantedWidth).

- **Behavior:**
  - Computes scaling factors for width and height based on the desired new dimensions.
  - Chooses the smaller scaling factor to maintain the aspect ratio.
  - Computes the dimensions of the resized image using the selected scaling factor.
  - Creates a new bitmap with the desired dimensions.
  - Draws the original image onto the new bitmap, effectively resizing it.
  - Returns the resized bitmap.

## Aspect Ratio Maintenance

The computation of scaling factors and selection of the smaller scaling factor ensures that the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained during resizing. This is crucial to prevent any distortion in the image's appearance.

## Rendering the Resized Image

The `DrawFully`, `JustDraw`, `ResetDrawArea`, and `DrawBitmapOnDrawArea` methods are involved in rendering the resized image onto the drawing area, ensuring the drawing area is updated to reflect the new image dimensions.
