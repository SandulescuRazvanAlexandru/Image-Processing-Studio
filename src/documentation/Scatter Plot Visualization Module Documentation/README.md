# Scatter Plot Visualization Module Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the Visualization module responsible for visualizing the scaled data points as a scatter plot. It employs an external library provided as a .dll file to handle the visualization.

## Overview

The Visualization module is triggered by the `btnScatterPlot_Click` method, which is activated when the "Scatter Plot" button is clicked in the user interface. This method orchestrates the process of loading the scaled data points from the `Scalare.csv` file, preparing the data for visualization, and displaying the scatter plot.

## Core Method

### `btnScatterPlot_Click`

- **Parameters:**
  - `object sender`: The source of the event.
  - `EventArgs e`: An EventArgs that contains the event data.

- **Behavior:**
  - Checks if an image is loaded.
  - Prepares to read the hardcoded `Scalare.csv` file path which contains the scaled data points.
  - Creates a `DateVectoriale` object to represent the vectorial data.
  - Prepares a `VizualizareDate` object for data visualization.
  - Sets the chart type to a scatter plot.
  - Modifies the Z-coordinate of all points to 0; the exact purpose of this step is tied to the specifics of the external .dll library used for visualization.
  - Displays the scatter plot in a new dialog window.
  - Closes the file stream to the `Scalare.csv` file.

## Visualization Setup

The method configures the visualization by setting up the necessary objects and properties, utilizing an external library for rendering the scatter plot. The chart type is set to `TipuriDeGrafice.ChartTypeEnum.NorDePuncte`, which likely represents a scatter plot type of chart.

## Data Modification

The method includes a step that modifies the Z-coordinate of all points to 0. While the visualization is in 3D, this step appears to be a specific requirement tied to the external .dll library used for visualization.

## Additional Notes

The Visualization module relies on an external .dll library for rendering the scatter plot, and the source code for this library is not provided. The visualization is displayed in a new dialog window, allowing users to interact with the scatter plot.
